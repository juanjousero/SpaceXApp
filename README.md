# Space X App

Space X App developed with React, using SpaceX API.

A list of missions and sites where the rocket were launched is shown and all of them can be selected. One one mission is clicked, rocket name and type is updated, as well as characteristics of that rocket.

Apart from that, random numbers (inside an interval) are displayed, simulating values for each rocket.

Design has been obtained from Figma.

I hope you like it and, as always, any feedback is welcomed!
